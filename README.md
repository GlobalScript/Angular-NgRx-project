# Angular-NgRx-Project

This project consists of three separate parts:

- **Back-end API**: Responsible for the core business logic, data storage, and interaction with the database.
- **Admin Panel Site**: A front-end component that interacts with the back-end through the API to manage products and orders.
- **Client Site for Purchasing Products**: A separate front-end component that interacts with the same back-end API to display products and process orders.

## Project Overview

The main idea of this project is to create a microservice architecture. The goal is to build a system composed of independent services, each of which performs a specific function and interacts with other parts through well-defined APIs.
