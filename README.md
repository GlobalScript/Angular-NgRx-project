# Angular NgRx Node.js
The project consists of two parts: Backend API and the admin panel.
The admin panel is implemented using Angular and is located in this repository along with the Backend API.
The client view is implemented in another repository at this link: https://github.com/GlobalScript/React-online-screws-shop
All these parts are combined into a single system for creating products and processing orders that come from the online store to the admin panel.
The main idea is to create separate parts that can later be interchangeable or scalable by adding new applications.
The client view and the admin panel are interconnected through the Backend API.
